# julia-humanoids: meta-package for compatibility with openhumanoids/oh-distro

## Setup

```
make
```

This will create a folder `packages/v0.6/` and initialize it as a new Julia package directory. It will also generate a `config/setup.sh` script which will appropriately configure your Julia environment variables. To activate the Julia environment, just do:

```
source config/setup.sh
```
